# Metaverse Standards Forum GitHub

Open to any organization at no cost, the [Metaverse Standards Forum](https://metaverse-standards.org/) provides a venue for cooperation between standards organizations and companies to foster the development of interoperability standards for an open and inclusive metaverse, and to accelerate their deployment through pragmatic, action-based projects.

Forum Working Groups and Exploratory Groups use GitHub repositories to collaborate on draft and final versions of group content.

Anyone is welcome to [connect their GitHub account](https://tools.metaverse-standards.org/) to view and create Pull Requests in Forum repositories. Pull requests by non-members will be reviewed by Forum membership before being accepted.

For more information or questions on how to become a Forum member, please [Contact Us](https://metaverse-standards.org/#contact).
